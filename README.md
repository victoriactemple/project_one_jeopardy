# Project One - Jeopardy

Tasks: 
1. Write a Jeopardy game that allows the user to play the game of Jeopardy. 
2. This is a quiz game where the user gets to choose the next question by choosing from a category and then choosing a point amount (100 to 500). 
3. The questions are phrased as answers and the user chooses from a list of 4 questions that match the answer.

Description:

Here, there are 25 separate divs displaying values 100-500. I have hard-coded each one with a data-number ranging from 0-24 which corresponds with the index of the array of objects containing the answer, questions, correct answer, and cash value. Three functions do the rest of the heavy lifting. Once a user has selected and clicked a cash value button, a formerly hidden div appears with the answer and four questions. The user can click on any of the questions. If the user is correct in their guess, an alert is displayed and points are rewarded. If the user is incorrect, an alert is displayed and points are deducted.
